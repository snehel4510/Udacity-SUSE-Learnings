# Tools, Environment & Dependencies

## Install Docker

### Install using the repository

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

#### Set up the repository

1. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

2. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

```
 curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

3. Use the following command to set up the stable repository.

```
 echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

#### Install Docker Engine

1. Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

```
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

2. Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

```
 sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

Docker Engine is installed and running. The docker group is created but no users are added to it. You need to use sudo to run Docker commands. Continue to Linux postinstall to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps.

### Upgrade Docker Engine

To upgrade Docker Engine, first run `sudo apt-get update`, then follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository), choosing the new version you want to install.
